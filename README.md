# Embedded C Programming Activity with Continuous Integration and Code Quality

# About Project
## A heat control system is build using Atmega328.The button sensor first senses is a passenger or driver is onboarded in the car. When both button sensor and heat sensor are turned on the led glows.Only then the temperature sensor works and takes values from the ADC whose output is shown as pulse width modulation. All the data is transffered using UART communication protocal.
